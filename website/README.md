JFR Events Site Generator
=========================

Uses the data from the [jfreventscollector](https://github.com/SAP/jfrevents)
project to generate a website with all the JFR events seen at [sap.github.io/jfrevents](https://sap.github.io/jfrevents).

*This has historically been its own repository, but got merged for simplicity.*

java -jar target/jfrevents-site-generator.jar site

## Troubleshooting
Builds might take longer on newer maven versions due to blocking
of http resources (and I don't know which).
Maven 3.6.3 seems to work fine.
